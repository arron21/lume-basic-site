title: Love and Monsters - Movie Review
---
I liked this movie. After watching the trailer and seeing the monsters I knew I had to see it. The visuals in this movie are exceptional. The environment design gave me Annihilation (2018) vibes, which is a good thing. There are plenty of gorgeous landscape shots that made me go "wow this definitely is not California"; turns out the movie was shot in Australia.

The monsters in the movie are both massive and fantastic. This film is not a scary film but there are parts where you will worry for the characters quite a bit. If you are like me you will be cuddling next to your dog after this movie, as the dog is the true Love part of this movie.

Characters... I do wish the characters were fleshed out more. Most characters have names and I would assume some interesting backstory but they are never revealed. Clyde (Michael Rooker) and Minnow (Ariana Greenblatt) were both fantastic and definitely the most fun part of the film. Dylan O'Brien was not bad but I have yet to see him a role that really pushes him. 

I did find myself wondering had this movie been rated R what kind of film it might have been, but this film was PG-13 and the themes and tone of the film don't stretch far from it.

In conclusion, the dog was the best, and the monster and set design was absolutely incredible and worth a watch just for that.

3/5
