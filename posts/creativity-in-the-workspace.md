title: Don't waste your creative energy
---
So you are a software developer, artist, creative.

You have great ideas and would love to see your ideas come to life in the workplace.

You want to build, you want to create!

Yet the company you work for doesn't see eye to eye with your vision.

You get frustrated.

you get burnt out.

There is a very simple strategy to not feeling this way.

Ready?

Stop.

Stop trying to implement the new ways of doing things, your new ideas, your creativity.

But, don't stop it entirely!

Just stop doing it at your job.

Some jobs encourage creativity and new solutions, and some jobs do not.

Instead of wasting your energy trying to move a rock that won't move, start using your creativity in a different project.

Create something brand new.
Creativity is a terrible thing to waste, so don't waste it.

If you are going to use your creative energy use it for something you can be proud of, something that is yours. Something that is entirely your idea.
