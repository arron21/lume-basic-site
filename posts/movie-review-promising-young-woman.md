title: Movie Review, Promising Young Woman
---
TL:DR; Incredibly disappointing

I had high hopes for this film. Since it is being nominated for...

Best Motion Picture of the Year

Best Achievement in Directing

Best Original Screenplay

Best Achievement in Film Editing

at the OSCARS

Who know who else won Best Motion Picture? The Godfather in **1973**

Promising Young Woman does not even breath the same air as the Godfather.

Whoever nominated Promising Young Woman for so many awards must have been high, because this movie has so many things wrong with it.

The IMDB description is as follows "A young woman, traumatized by a tragic event in her past, seeks out vengeance against those who crossed her path."

So its a revenge film right?

This movie was so bad I can't even finish this review, i'll have to come back to it later.
